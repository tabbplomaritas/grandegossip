  <h3>part one</h3>
    <p>lilliana started gymnastics when she was 2 and a half. she fell a couple times but that didn't stop her. she went again and again but one day at gymnastics 
      <br>she fell 
      <br> she fell <strong>hard</strong>
      <br>she fell <strong>real hard</strong> 
      <br> she fell <strong>real real hard</strong> 
      <br>she cried. she oh mighty right cried.
      she went home in tears. not because the pain because she was giving up her dream):
    <h3>part two</h3>
<p>
  a couple years later her mom gave her a late birthday present. "here" mom said "o.m.g. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" she said. "its your pass to gymnastics the same one you went to" "huh" she said. "huh"
  mom said. 
  </p>
<p>
  "huh" she said. "huh" mom said "lets just go to tryouts!"
after a couple weeks she finally she had her finale she salutes and handstands then cartwheels and forward rolls and salutes again then she won first place
