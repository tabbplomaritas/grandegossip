<h2>Ariana's Life</h2>

<p>Ariana actually started her career in acting! When she was young she was in lots of musicals like Beauty and the Beast and Annie, but was later cast as Cat Valentine in Nickelodeon's show Victorious! 
That's right, Ariana had bright red hair in the show. It's rumoured Ariana actually had to dye her hair red every other week! This damaged her hair which is why she often wears those long hair extensions she's so famous for. 
Ariana was always keen to pursue a career in music. While she was filming Victorious, she uploaded some videos onto YouTube of her covering singers like Mariah Carey and Adele. She was spotted by Republic records who signed her onto their label! Lucky Ari! Those videos must have been amazing!
That's right, she has 9 rescue dogs! As if we couldn't love her enough! They are called Toulouse, Ophelia, Fawkes, Cinnamon, Coco, Lafayette, Sirius, Strauss and Pignoli.
